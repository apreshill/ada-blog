From a [Wikipedia article](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) on me:

I am an English writer. I became the world's first computer programmer. I wrote the program for Charles Babbage's mechanical computer, "The Analytical Engine", in 1844. I wrote the first algorithm to be processed by a machine. Between 1842 and 1843, I translated an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea on the engine. I added my own notes to it. These notes contain what is considered the first computer program, which was an algorithm encoded for processing by a machine. Though Babbage's engine was never built, my notes are important in the early history of computers. I realized that computers would be able to do more than just calculating or number-crunching. Others, including Babbage himself, worked only on the possibilities of calculating.
